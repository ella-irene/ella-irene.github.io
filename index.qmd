# Data Scientist 


Creative, results-driven Masters student at the University of British Columbia (UBC), with a background in environmental chemistry. 

Throughout my education and work experiences, I've developed a passion for machine learning and data visualization. I love using data to tell stories. I also love drawing, running, and drinking good coffee :)
